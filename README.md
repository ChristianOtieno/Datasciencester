Motivating Hypothetical: DataSciencester

____
_Congratulations!_ You’ve just been hired to lead the data science efforts at DataSciencester, the social network for data scientists.
>Despite being for data scientists, DataSciencester has never actually invested in building its own data science practice. (In fairness, DataSciencester has never really invested in building its product either.) That will be your job! Throughout the book, we’ll be learning about data science concepts by solving problems that you encounter at work. Sometimes we’ll look at data explicitly supplied by users, sometimes we’ll look at data generated through their interactions with the site, and sometimes we’ll even look at data from experiments that we’ll design.
>And because DataSciencester has a strong “not-invented-here” mentality, we’ll be building our own tools from scratch. At the end, you’ll have a pretty solid understanding of the fundamentals of data science. And you’ll be ready to apply your skills at a company with a less shaky premise, or to any other problems that happen to interest you.
Welcome aboard, and good luck! (You’re allowed to wear jeans on Fridays, and the bathroom is down the hall on the right.)
